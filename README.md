### :alien: Heya there!
I'm a junior developer with a lot to learn so I mostly come here to experiment with new things as I learn them. Hoping to make this readme fancier as I go :3 

### :dart: Projects
Here lies the details of all the projects I'm working on:

### :cyclone: Technology Stack
This is where I specify the languages, libraries, databases (etc.) that I've worked with so far!

HTML

```HTML
<html>
   <body>
     <p>My very first brush of programming that introduced me to a world of possibilities</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

CSS

```CSS
.custom_button {
  border: 2px solid #CCC;
  padding: 7px 5px;
  background-color: white;
}
/* Admittedly, I use up a lot of my time here obsessing over creating the perfect component */
```
